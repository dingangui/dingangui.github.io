Hello! I am Ganggui, a fourth-year (2020-now) Ph.D. student of Zhejiang University, under the supervision of Prof. [Chunhua Shen](https://cshen.github.io) and [Hao Chen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=FaOqRpcAAAAJ). My research interests are diffusion model and 3-D reconstruction, focusing on image customization, face customization, large multi-modal model, and other directions. You can find my open source project on [Github](https://github.com/dingangui).
